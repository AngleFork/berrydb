## Prerequisites

available in all popular Linux distributions, as well as in
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

This project uses submodules for dependency management.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If you're using [Atom](https://atom.io/), the following packages can help.

```bash
apm install autocomplete-clang build build-cmake clang-format docblockr \
    language-cmake linter linter-clang
```

## Building

The following commands build the project.

```bash
mkdir out
cd out
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```

## Development

The following command (when executed from `out/`) (re)builds the project and
runs the tests.

```bash
cmake .. && cmake --build . && ctest --output-on-failure
```
